ü§èSimpleGPT is a vim plugin designed to provide the simplest method for:
- Constructing and sending questions to ChatGPT
- Presenting the response in the most convenient manner.

## Motivation of this plugin
Though we have [a lot of ChatGPT plugins](#related-projects) to leverage the power of ChatGPT in Vim, I still find it hard to locate a handy one that completely fits my workflow.

After thinking about it, I found that the main reason is that the most important part of my workflow is missing in existing plugins: **Fast editing of questions based on my current status**!!

So, **quickly editing the question template and building the question** is the most important part of my workflow. Existing plugins are not convenient enough for this and focus more on the Chat UI.

This repository is designed to offer a highly customizable and extensible QA interaction with ChatGPT in the simplest way possible.

# Installation
```lua
-- TODO: update the content according to `tests/init_configs/lazy.lua`
-- Lazy.nvim
{
  "you-n-g/simplegpt.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    -- "jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim", -- You should configure your ChatGPT make sure it works.
    {
      "jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim",
      event = "VeryLazy",
      config = true,
      dependencies = {

      },
    },
  },
  config = true,
},
-- or packer.nvim
use({
  "you-n-g/simplegpt.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("simplegpt").setup()
  end,
  requires = {
    {
      "jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim",

# Demo

## Typical workflow & Shortcuts
![Workflow](https://i.imgur.com/MHdmQaX.png)

The question is constructed by rendering a template. The 't' register serves as the template, encompassing:
- Special variables such as {{content}}, {{filetype}}, and {{visual}}.
- Standard registers like {{a}}, {{b}}, and {{c}}.

# Features

## Shutcuts
- Dialog shortcuts:
  - For all dialogs
    - `{"q", "<C-c>", "<esc>"}`: exit the dialog;
    - `{"C-k"}` Copy code in triple backquotes of current buffer;
  - For only `ChatDialog` (The dialog that are able to get response)
    - `{"C-a"}`: Append the response to current meeting.
    - `{"C-y"}`: Copy the full response to the clipboard.
    - `{"C-r"}`: Replace the selected visual text or current line.

- Normal shortcuts start with `<LocalLeader>g`
    - `<LocalLeader>gl`: load registers
    - `<LocalLeader>gD`: dump registers
    - `<LocalLeader>ge`: edit registers
    - `<LocalLeader>gs`: send question to clipboard
    - `<LocalLeader>gc`: send question to ChatGPT
    - `<LocalLeader>gr`: send to get direct response
    - `<LocalLeader>gd`: send to get response with diff
    - `<LocalLeader>gR`: resume last popup
    - `<LocalLeader>gp`: load current file to reg
    - `<LocalLeader>gP`: append current file to reg
- Shortcuts for combined actions:  Loading template + send to target
  - By default, they start with `<LocalLeader>s`.
  - [Full list of shortcuts](lua/simplegpt/conf.lua#L25)
    - `<LocalLeader>sr`: (R)ewrite Text
    - `<LocalLeader>sc`: (C)omplete Code
    - `<LocalLeader>sg`: Fix (g)rammar
    - `<LocalLeader>sd`: Con(d)ense
    - `<LocalLeader>st`: Con(t)inue

# Development

Welcome to contribute to this project.

You can test the plugin with minimal config with
- `vim -u tests/init_configs/lazy.lua -U NONE -N -i NONE` for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- For [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
  - Please install [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) first.
  - Run `vim -u tests/init_configs/packer.lua  -U NONE -N -i NONE`

# Limitations

- It only leverage the `ChatCompletion` API (which is the most powerful and frequently used in the future trend).
- It is based on Vim registers, which may conflict with users' usage of them.
