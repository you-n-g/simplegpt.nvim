# Motivation of this plugin
Though we have [a lot of ChatGPT plugins](#related-projects) to leverage the power of ChatGPT in Vim, I still find it hard to locate a handy one that completely fits my workflow.

After thinking about it, I found that the main reason is that the most important part of my workflow is missing in existing plugins: **Fast editing of questions based on my current status**!!

So, quickly editing the question template and building the question is the most important part of my workflow. Existing plugins are not convenient enough for this and focus more on the Chat UI.

This repository is designed to offer a highly customizable and extensible QA interaction with ChatGPT in the simplest way possible.
