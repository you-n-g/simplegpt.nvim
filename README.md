ü§èSimpleGPT is a Vim plugin designed to provide a simple yet flexible way to:
- Construct and send questions to ChatGPT
- Present the response in the most convenient manner.

## Motivation of this plugin
Though we have [a lot of ChatGPT plugins](#related-projects) to leverage the power of ChatGPT in Vim, I still find it hard to locate a handy one that completely fits my workflow.

After thinking about it, I found that the main reason is that the most important part of my workflow is missing in existing plugins: **Fast editing of questions based on my current status**!!

So, **quickly editing the question template and building the question** is the most important part of my workflow. Existing plugins are not convenient enough for this and focus more on the Chat UI.

This repository is designed to offer a highly customizable and extensible QA interaction with ChatGPT in the simplest way possible.

# Installation
‚ö†Ô∏èPlease follow the [installation guide of ChatGPT.nvim](https://github.com/jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to make sure your ChatGPT works.
```lua

## Typical workflow & Shortcuts
I have attempted to summarize the key concepts and manual in one image.

![Workflow](https://i.imgur.com/bPx6C1D.png)

The question is constructed by rendering a template. The 't' register serves as the template, encompassing:
- Special variables such as `{{content}}`, `{{filetype}}`, and `{{visual}}`.
- Standard registers like `{{a}}`, `{{b}}`, and `{{c}}`.


# Features

## Custom Template Path

You can specify a custom template path for loading and dumping files by setting the `custom_template_path` option in your configuration. If the specified path does not exist, it will be created automatically.

Example configuration:
```lua
require("simplegpt").setup({
  custom_template_path = "~/my_custom_templates/"
})
```

This will ensure that templates are loaded from and dumped to the specified custom path if it exists. If the custom path is not specified or the file does not exist in the custom path, the default path will be used.

### Registering Custom Shortcuts

You can register custom shortcuts to use templates from the custom template path. Here is an example of how to configure custom shortcuts:

```lua
require("simplegpt").setup({
  custom_template_path = "~/my_custom_templates/",
  keymaps = {
    custom_shortcuts = {
      ["<LocalLeader>sq"] = {
        mode = { "n", "v" },
        tpl = "my_custom_template.json",
        target = "popup",
        opts = { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = "Use custom template" },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

In this example, pressing `<LocalLeader>sq` in normal or visual mode will load the `my_custom_template.json` from the custom template path and send it to the popup target.

## Core workflow

The primary concepts that govern the functionality of this plugin are:

- Register-based, template-driven question construction: This approach allows for the dynamic creation of questions by leveraging the power of Vim registers. The registers serve as placeholders within the template, which are then replaced with the appropriate content during the question construction process.

- Dumping and loading of registers: This feature enables the preservation of register content across different sessions. It's important to note that temporary registers, denoted by `{{p-}}`, are exempt from this process and their content is not saved to disk.

- Response display targets: This refers to the destination where the response from ChatGPT is displayed. The plugin offers flexibility in choosing the target, allowing for a more tailored user experience.

## Registers

### An Example of Template Rendering

To illustrate the core template rendering mechanism of SimpleGPT, consider the following example. We have a template in the 't' register:

"I am currently working on a {{filetype}} file. The content of the file is: {{content}}. I have selected the following lines: {{visual}}. My question is: {{q}}."

The register values are:

- `{{filetype}}` is 'markdown'
- `{{content}}` is 'This is a sample markdown file.'
- `{{visual}}` is 'This is a selected.'
- `{{q}}` is 'How can I improve this line?'

The constructed question becomes:

"I am currently working on a markdown file. The content of the file is: This is a sample markdown file. I have selected the following lines: This is a selected line. My question is: How can I improve this line?"

Registers are of two types:

- Native vim registers: Standard Vim registers like 't', 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. used for storing and retrieving text.
- Special registers: Specific to SimpleGPT, including `{{content}}`, `{{filetype}}`, `{{visual}}`, and `{{q}}`. They store special values used in the template process. The `{{q}}` register allows for an editable question when rendering the whole content.

### vim-native registers

| Register | meaning                              |
| -        | -                                    |
| t        | The register for the template.       |
| others   | the variables to render the template |


### Supported special registers
| key      | meaning                                                     |
| -        | -                                                           |
| content  | the whole file content                                      |
| filetype | the filetype of the file                                    |
| visual   | the selected lines                                          |
| context  | the nearby context of the selected line(10 lines up & down) |



## Shutcuts
- Dialog shortcuts:
  - For all dialogs
    - `{"q", "<C-c>", "<esc>"}`: exit the dialog;
    - `{"C-k"}` Copy code in triple backquotes of current buffer;
  - For only `ChatDialog` (The dialog that are able to get response)
    - `{"C-a"}`: Append the response to current meeting.
    - `{"C-y"}`: Copy the full response to the clipboard.
    - `{"C-r"}`: Replace the selected visual text or current line.

- Normal shortcuts start with `<LocalLeader>g`
  - Register operations
    - `<LocalLeader>gl`: load registers
    - `<LocalLeader>gD`: dump registers
    - `<LocalLeader>ge`: edit registers
  - Send to target
    - `<LocalLeader>gs`: send question to clipboard
    - `<LocalLeader>gc`: send question to ChatGPT

    - `<LocalLeader>gd`: send to get response with diff
  - Other operations
    - `<LocalLeader>gR`: resume last popup
    - `<LocalLeader>gp`: load current file to reg
    - `<LocalLeader>gP`: append current file to reg
- Shortcuts for combined actions:  Loading template + send to target
  - By default, they start with `<LocalLeader>s`.
  - [Full list of shortcuts](lua/simplegpt/conf.lua#L25)
    - `<LocalLeader>sr`: (R)ewrite Text
    - `<LocalLeader>sc`: (C)omplete Code
    - `<LocalLeader>sg`: Fix (g)rammar
    - `<LocalLeader>sd`: Con(d)ense
    - `<LocalLeader>st`: Con(t)inue

## Custom Template Path

You can specify a custom template path for loading and dumping files by setting the `custom_template_path` option in your configuration. If the specified path does not exist, it will be created automatically.

Example configuration:
```lua
require("simplegpt").setup({
  custom_template_path = "~/my_custom_templates/"
})
```

This will ensure that templates are loaded from and dumped to the specified custom path if it exists. If the custom path is not specified or the file does not exist in the custom path, the default path will be used.
