🤏SimpleGPT is a simple, **QA-customizable** plugin for interacting with ChatGPT in Vim.

## Motivation of this plugin
Though we have [a lot of ChatGPT plugins](#related-projects) to leverage the power of ChatGPT in Vim, I still find it hard to locate a handy one that completely fits my workflow.

After thinking about it, I found that the main reason is that the most important part of my workflow is missing in existing plugins: **Fast editing of questions based on my current status**!!

So, **quickly editing the question template and building the question** is the most important part of my workflow. Existing plugins are not convenient enough for this and focus more on the Chat UI.

This repository is designed to offer a highly customizable and extensible QA interaction with ChatGPT in the simplest way possible.

- Bugs

- More features that may be added in the long future
  - Automatically ask questions based on the current context(Currently we have to manually select and ask the question)

# Development

Welcome to contribute to this project.

You can test the plugin with minimal config with
- `vim -u tests/init_configs/lazy.lua -U NONE -N -i NONE` for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

# Limitations

- It only leverage the `ChatCompletion` API (which is the most powerful and frequently used in the future trend).
- It is based on Vim registers, which may conflict with users' usage of them.
