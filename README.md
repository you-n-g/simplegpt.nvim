ü§èSimpleGPT is a Vim plugin designed to provide a simple (high transparency based on Jinja) yet flexible way (context-aware based on buffer, visual selection, LSP info, etc.) to customize your LLM/ChatGPT prompts for your tasks (finishing tasks by replacing with diff comparison, appending, etc.).

- Why ü§èSimpleGPT: **You need customized LLM/ChatGPT prompts for your tasks**.
  - AI Coding Plugins didn't provide support for every scenario.
    - General tasks beyond coding:
      - Article writing.
      - Reading, notetaking, summarizing.
      - Translating.
  - Even for specific tasks that AI Coding supports, using a customized prompt and workflow is often more effective and smooth.

## Design Philosophy

ü§èSimpleGPT's efforts can be categorized into the following parts:
- **Prompt Templates**: Create your own prompt templates using a Jinja template engine. [Details](#custom-jinja-based-prompt-template)
- **Context-aware Question Building**: Construct questions based on the template and the current context, followed by multi-round chat instruction.
- **Flexible Response Presenting**: Present the response in the most convenient way (we provide options like diff, popup, replace, append).

This allows you to easily build a LLM-based toolbox with ü§èSimpleGPT.

We provide a tools gallery for basic usage, which also serves as examples for further customization.

The question is constructed by rendering a template. The 't' register serves as the template, encompassing:
- Special variables such as `{{content}}`, `{{filetype}}`, and `{{visual}}`.
- Standard registers like `{{a}}`, `{{b}}`, and `{{c}}`.


# Features

## Custom Jinja-based Prompt Template

Here is a gif demo that quickly showcases the customization process.
[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7469b4e3-6058-4a9c-b83f-6bd9536ba03e)](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fb1ne4nt6ubae1.gif)


### Setting a Custom Template Path
You can specify a custom template path for loading and dumping files by setting the `custom_template_path` option in your configuration. If the specified path does not exist, it will be created automatically.

Example configuration:
```lua
require("simplegpt").setup({
  custom_template_path = "~/my_custom_templates/"
})
```
When you set a custom_template_path:
- If a template is specified and it exists in the custom path, it will be loaded from and saved to that path.
- If the template file doesn't exist in the custom path, a new file will be created there when you save the registers.

### Steps to create a new template

#### Creating the template directly from file

1. **Create a Template File**: Navigate to your custom template path and create a `.json` file.

2. **Define Template Structure**: Add your template with placeholders:
   ```json
   {
     "t": "I am working on a {{filetype}} file. The content is: {{content}}. Selected lines: {{visual}}. Question: {{q}}."
   }
   ```

3. **Save**: Save the file in `custom_template_path`.

#### Creating the Template in Vim

1. **Set the 't' Register**: In Vim, set the 't' register:
   ```vim
   " setting it with command
   :let @t = "I am working on a {{filetype}} file. The content is: {{content}}. Selected lines: {{visual}}. Question: {{q}}."
   " or use `"ty` to copy the content to the 't' register
   ```

2. **Dump the Register**: Use the shortcut to dump the 't' register:
   ```vim
   :<LocalLeader>gD
   ```
### Registering Custom Shortcuts

You can register custom shortcuts to use templates from the custom template path. Here is an example of how to configure custom shortcuts:

```lua
require("simplegpt").setup({
  custom_template_path = "~/my_custom_templates/",
  keymaps = {
    custom_shortcuts = {
      ["<LocalLeader>sQ"] = {
        mode = { "n", "v" },
        tpl = "my_custom_template.json",
        target = "popup",
        opts = { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = "Use custom template" },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

In this example, pressing `<LocalLeader>sQ` in normal or visual mode will load the `my_custom_template.json` from the custom template path and send it to the popup target.

### Core workflow

The primary concepts that govern the functionality of this plugin are:

- Register-based, template-driven question construction: This approach allows for the dynamic creation of questions by leveraging the power of Vim registers. The registers serve as placeholders within the template, which are then replaced with the appropriate content during the question construction process.

- Dumping and loading of registers: This feature enables the preservation of register content across different sessions. It's important to note that temporary registers, denoted by `{{p-}}`, are exempt from this process and their content is not saved to disk.

- Response display targets: This refers to the destination where the response from ChatGPT is displayed. The plugin offers flexibility in choosing the target, allowing for a more tailored user experience.

### Registers

#### An Example of Template Rendering

To illustrate the core template rendering mechanism of SimpleGPT, consider the following example. We have a template in the 't' register:

"I am currently working on a {{filetype}} file. The content of the file is: {{content}}. I have selected the following lines: {{visual}}. My question is: {{q}}."

The register values are:

- `{{filetype}}` is 'markdown'
- `{{content}}` is 'This is a sample markdown file.'
- `{{visual}}` is 'This is a selected.'
- `{{q}}` is 'How can I improve this line?'

The constructed question becomes:

"I am currently working on a markdown file. The content of the file is: This is a sample markdown file. I have selected the following lines: This is a selected line. My question is: How can I improve this line?"

Registers are of two types:

- Native vim registers: Standard Vim registers like 't', 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. used for storing and retrieving text.
- Special registers: Specific to SimpleGPT, including `{{content}}`, `{{filetype}}`, `{{visual}}`, and `{{q}}`. They store special values used in the template process. The `{{q}}` register allows for an editable question when rendering the whole content.

#### vim-native registers

| Register | meaning                              |
| -        | -                                    |
| t        | The register for the template.       |
| others   | the variables to render the template |


#### Supported special registers
You can use these variables in your jinja template.
| key          | meaning                                                     |
| -            | -                                                           |
| content      | Content around the cursor, limited by a configurable length |
| full_content | Entire content of the current file                          |
| filetype     | Filetype of the current buffer                              |
| visual       | Lines selected in visual mode                               |
| context      | Context around the cursor, configurable lines up/down       |
| all_buf      | Content from all loaded buffers with files on disk          |
| lsp_diag     | LSP diagnostics information for the selected lines          |

#### Template Engine

SimpleGPT uses a Jinja-like template engine ([jinja-engine.nvim](https://github.com/you-n-g/jinja-engine.nvim)) to power its template system:

- **Variable Interpolation**: Access registers using `{{register_name}}` syntax
  ```json
  {
    "t": "I am working on a {{filetype}} file. The content is: {{content}}. Selected lines: {{visual}}. Question: {{q}}."
  }
  ```

- **Control Structures**: Use Jinja-style control flow
  ```jinja
  {% if visual %}Selected: {{visual}}{% else %}No selection{% endif %}
  ```

The template engine provides familiar Jinja-style syntax while being fully integrated with Neovim.

## Post-response Actions

After receiving a response from ChatGPT, you can perform several actions to integrate the output into your workflow:

- **Append**: Use the Append action (e.g., `<C-a>` key) to add the response to your original buffer.
- **Replace**: Use the Replace action (e.g., `<C-r>` key) to substitute the selected text, current line, or entire file with the response.
- **Yank**: Use the Yank action (e.g., `<C-y>` key) to copy the response to the clipboard.
- **Search and Replace**: Use the Search and Replace action (e.g., `<m-r>` key) to apply automated modifications via SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
- **Chat/Continue**: Use the Chat action (e.g., `<m-c>` key) to continue the conversation or refine the response.

# Development

Welcome to contribute to this project.

You can test the plugin with minimal config with
- `vim -u tests/init_configs/lazy.lua -U NONE -N -i NONE` for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- For [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
  - Please install [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) first.
  - Run `vim -u tests/init_configs/packer.lua  -U NONE -N -i NONE`

# Limitations

- It only leverage the `ChatCompletion` API (which is the most powerful and frequently used in the future trend).
- It is based on Vim registers, which may conflict with users' usage of them.
