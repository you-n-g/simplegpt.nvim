🤏SimpleGPT is a Vim plugin designed to provide a simple (high transparency
based on Jinja) yet flexible way (context-aware based on buffer, visual
selection, LSP info, terminal etc.) to customize your LLM/ChatGPT prompts for
your tasks (building chat or finishing tasks by replacing them with diff
comparison, appending, SEARCH/REPLACE etc.) on nearly all kinds of LLM APIs.


WHY 🤏SIMPLEGPT:               *simplegpt-🤏-simplegpt-why-🤏simplegpt:*


YOU NEED CUSTOMIZED LLM/CHATGPT PROMPTS FOR YOUR TASKS. ~

- AI Coding Plugins didn’t provide support for every scenario.
    - General tasks beyond coding:
        - Article writing.
        - Reading, notetaking, summarizing.
        - Translating.
- Even for specific tasks that AI Coding supports, using a customized prompt and workflow is often more effective and smooth.


YOU JUST NEED A SIMPLE WAY TO CHAT WITH ALL KINDS LLM ~

For a long time, I’ve been looking for a simple way to chat in VIM with any
LLM—just having a conversation, without pulling in my codebase as context
(VIM is a tool far beyond code). - 🍰 Why a simple way? Many LLM-chatting
plugins come with lots of features—session management, code extraction,
shortcuts to scroll content, and more. But as an experienced Vim user, I
already have many of these features through my plugins. If I can just chat in a
buffer, I have everything I need. Extra shortcuts that don’t fit my setup
only add unnecessary complexity. - 🦾 Can’t existing chat plugins support
all kinds of LLMs? While pure Vim-powered chat plugins like
jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim <https://github.com/jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim> and
robitx/gp.nvim <https://github.com/Robitx/gp.nvim> are excellent, they do not
support reasoning models.

SimpleGPT aims to solve this problem. - 🍰 It only provides the core feature
to chat in an existing buffer. The chat will be organized by emoji like
👤(user), 🤖(AI), 💻(system). and only one customizable shortcut, which
is `<LocalLeader>gc` (to trigger chat completion or stop the chat completion
stream). - 🦾 It supports all kinds of LLMs, including reasoning models.
It’s backend is based on yetone/avante.nvim
<https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim>, which supports a wide range of LLMs.

What’s more! - Simple here means we removed features that Vim users don’t
need. - We also include a Jinja engine to help you use context in your chats
more quickly. This is the key for efficient chatting. You can create your own
templates over time to chat even more efficiently.

Here is a Jinja template example (this shows how you can build rich,
context-aware chat experiences):

>jinja
    You are an expert in programming.
    
    {% if p %}
    Here are a list of files for reference.
    {{p-}}
    {% endif %}
    
    We have a file named {{filename}} with content:
    ````{{filetype}} 
    {{content}}
    ````
    
    {%if terminal%}
    You encountered error when running or compiling it
    ```
    {{terminal}}
    ```
    {% endif %}
    
    
    {% if visual %}The error are potentially caused by the following code block(We call it *focused code block*).
    ```{{filetype}} 
    {{visual}}
    ```
    Please only return the code to replace the *focused code block*{% else %}
    {{f-}}
    {% endif %}
    
    {{q}}
<


DESIGN PHILOSOPHY                 *simplegpt-🤏-simplegpt-design-philosophy*

🤏SimpleGPT’s efforts can be categorized into the following parts: -
**Prompt Templates**: Create your own prompt templates using a Jinja template
engine. |simplegpt-details| - **Context-aware Question Building**: Construct
questions based on the template and the current context, followed by
multi-round chat instruction. - **Flexible Response Presenting**: Present the
response in the most convenient way (we provide options like diff, popup,
replace, append).

This allows you to easily build a LLM-based toolbox with 🤏SimpleGPT.

We provide a tools gallery for basic usage, which also serves as examples for
further customization.

TYPICAL WORKFLOW & SHORTCUTS    *simplegpt-demos-typical-workflow-&-shortcuts*

I have attempted to summarize the key concepts and manual in one image.

The question is constructed by rendering a template. The 't' register serves as
the template, encompassing: - Special variables such as `{{content}}`,
`{{filetype}}`, and `{{visual}}`. - Standard registers like `{{a}}`, `{{b}}`,
and `{{c}}`.


==============================================================================
4. Features                                               *simplegpt-features*


CUSTOM JINJA-BASED PROMPT TEMPLATE*simplegpt-features-custom-jinja-based-prompt-template*

Here is a gif demo that quickly showcases the customization process.
<https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fb1ne4nt6ubae1.gif>


SETTING A CUSTOM TEMPLATE PATH ~

You can specify a custom template path for loading and dumping files by setting
the `custom_template_path` option in your configuration. If the specified path
does not exist, it will be created automatically.

Example configuration:

>lua
    require("simplegpt").setup({
      custom_template_path = "~/my_custom_templates/"
    })
<

When you set a custom_template_path: - If a template is specified and it exists
in the custom path, it will be loaded from and saved to that path. - If the
template file doesn’t exist in the custom path, a new file will be created
there when you save the registers.


STEPS TO CREATE A NEW TEMPLATE ~


CREATING THE TEMPLATE DIRECTLY FROM FILE

1. **Create a Template File**: Navigate to your custom template path and create a
`.json` file.


2. **Define Template Structure**: Add your template with placeholders:

>json
    {
      "t": "I am working on a {{filetype}} file. The content is: {{content}}. Selected lines: {{visual}}. Question: {{q}}."
    }
<


3. **Save**: Save the file in `custom_template_path`.




CREATING THE TEMPLATE IN VIM

1. **Set the ‘t’ Register**: In Vim, set the 't' register:

>vim
    " setting it with command
    :let @t = "I am working on a {{filetype}} file. The content is: {{content}}. Selected lines: {{visual}}. Question: {{q}}."
    " or use `"ty` to copy the content to the 't' register
<


2. **Dump the Register**: Use the shortcut to dump the 't' register:

>vim
    :<LocalLeader>gD
<


REGISTERING CUSTOM SHORTCUTS ~



You can register custom shortcuts to use templates from the custom template
path. Here is an example of how to configure custom shortcuts:

>lua
    require("simplegpt").setup({
      custom_template_path = "~/my_custom_templates/",
      keymaps = {
        custom_shortcuts = {
          ["<LocalLeader>sQ"] = {
            mode = { "n", "v" },
            tpl = "my_custom_template.json",
            target = "popup",
            opts = { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = "Use custom template" },
          },
        },
      },
    })
<

In this example, pressing `<LocalLeader>sQ` in normal or visual mode will load
the `my_custom_template.json` from the custom template path and send it to the
popup target.


CORE WORKFLOW ~

The primary concepts that govern the functionality of this plugin are:

- Register-based, template-driven question construction: This approach allows for
    the dynamic creation of questions by leveraging the power of Vim registers. The
    registers serve as placeholders within the template, which are then replaced
    with the appropriate content during the question construction process.
- Dumping and loading of registers: This feature enables the preservation of
    register content across different sessions. It’s important to note that
    temporary registers, denoted by `{{p-}}`, are exempt from this process and
    their content is not saved to disk.
- Response display targets: This refers to the destination where the response
    from ChatGPT is displayed. The plugin offers flexibility in choosing the
    target, allowing for a more tailored user experience.


REGISTERS ~


AN EXAMPLE OF TEMPLATE RENDERING

To illustrate the core template rendering mechanism of SimpleGPT, consider the
following example. We have a template in the 't' register:

"I am currently working on a {{filetype}} file. The content of the file is:
{{content}}. I have selected the following lines: {{visual}}. My question is:
{{q}}."

The register values are:

- `{{filetype}}` is 'markdown'
- `{{content}}` is 'This is a sample markdown file.'
- `{{visual}}` is 'This is a selected.'
- `{{q}}` is 'How can I improve this line?'

The constructed question becomes:

"I am currently working on a markdown file. The content of the file is: This is
a sample markdown file. I have selected the following lines: This is a selected
line. My question is: How can I improve this line?"

Registers are of two types:

- Native vim registers: Standard Vim registers like 't', 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. used for storing and retrieving text.
- Special registers: Specific to SimpleGPT, including `{{content}}`, `{{filetype}}`, `{{visual}}`, and `{{q}}`. They store special values used in the template process. The `{{q}}` register allows for an editable question when rendering the whole content.


VIM-NATIVE REGISTERS

  Register   meaning
  ---------- --------------------------------------
  t          The register for the template.
  others     the variables to render the template

SUPPORTED SPECIAL REGISTERS

You can use these variables in your jinja template. | key | meaning | | - | - |
| content | Content around the cursor, limited by a configurable length | |
full_content | Entire content of the current file | | filetype | Filetype of
the current buffer | | visual | Lines selected in visual mode | | context |
Context around the cursor, configurable lines up/down | | all_buf | Content
from all loaded buffers with files on disk | | lsp_diag | LSP diagnostics
information for the selected lines | | md_context | Directly loading the
content in `.sgpt.md` as the register value. | | filename | The name of the
current file | | terminal | The content from the active (visiable) terminal
buffer, capturing recent terminal output (if available) | | full_terminal |
like terminal, but including all terminal output | | p | If register `p`
contains a list of file paths (one per line), its value becomes the
concatenation of the content from each of those files. Files that do not exist
will be skipped. |


TEMPLATE ENGINE

SimpleGPT uses a Jinja-like template engine (jinja-engine.nvim
<https://github.com/you-n-g/jinja-engine.nvim>) to power its template system:

- **Variable Interpolation**: Access registers using `{{register_name}}` syntax
    >json
        {
          "t": "I am working on a {{filetype}} file. The content is: {{content}}. Selected lines: {{visual}}. Question: {{q}}."
        }
    <
- **Control Structures**: Use Jinja-style control flow
    >jinja
        {% if visual %}Selected: {{visual}}{% else %}No selection{% endif %}
    <

The template engine provides familiar Jinja-style syntax while being fully
integrated with Neovim.


POST-RESPONSE ACTIONS               *simplegpt-features-post-response-actions*

After receiving a response from ChatGPT, you can perform several actions to
integrate the output into your workflow:

- **Append**: Use the Append action (e.g., `<C-a>` key) to add the response to your original buffer.
- **Replace**: Use the Replace action (e.g., `<C-r>` key) to substitute the selected text, current line, or entire file with the response.
- **Yank**: Use the Yank action (e.g., `<C-y>` key) to copy the response to the clipboard.
- **Search and Replace**: Use the Search and Replace action (e.g., `<m-r>` key) to apply automated modifications via SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
- **Chat/Continue**: Use the Chat action (e.g., `<m-c>` key) to continue the conversation or refine the response.


SHORTCUTS                                       *simplegpt-features-shortcuts*

- Dialog shortcuts:
    - For all dialogs
