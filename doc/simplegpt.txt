ü§èSimpleGPT is a Vim plugin designed to provide a simple yet flexible way to:
- Construct and send questions to ChatGPT - Present the response in the most
convenient manner.


MOTIVATION OF THIS PLUGIN *simplegpt-ü§è-simplegpt-motivation-of-this-plugin*

Though we have |simplegpt-a-lot-of-chatgpt-plugins| to leverage the power of
ChatGPT in Vim, I still find it hard to locate a handy one that completely fits
my workflow.

After thinking about it, I found that the main reason is that the most
important part of my workflow is missing in existing plugins: **Fast editing of
questions based on my current status**!!

So, **quickly editing the question template and building the question** is the
most important part of my workflow. Existing plugins are not convenient enough
for this and focus more on the Chat UI.

This repository is designed to offer a highly customizable and extensible QA
interaction with ChatGPT in the simplest way possible.

CONSOLE DEMO                                     *simplegpt-demo-console-demo*

<https://asciinema.org/a/zACiIRbgl0F6duRR8aJgtWbqr> - Building a comprehensive
question using the template mechanism. - Adding ad hoc requirements based on
the current context. - Implementing the code (default question) and translating
the comments into Chinese (special requirements). - The code that the demo is
based on is here <tests/demo/demo.py>.


TYPICAL WORKFLOW & SHORTCUTS     *simplegpt-demo-typical-workflow-&-shortcuts*

I have attempted to summarize the key concepts and manual in one image.

The question is constructed by rendering a template. The 't' register serves as
the template, encompassing: - Special variables such as `{{content}}`,
`{{filetype}}`, and `{{visual}}`. - Standard registers like `{{a}}`, `{{b}}`,
and `{{c}}`.

CORE WORKFLOW                               *simplegpt-features-core-workflow*

The primary concepts that govern the functionality of this plugin are:

- Register-based, template-driven question construction: This approach allows for
    the dynamic creation of questions by leveraging the power of Vim registers. The
    registers serve as placeholders within the template, which are then replaced
    with the appropriate content during the question construction process.
- Dumping and loading of registers: This feature enables the preservation of
    register content across different sessions. It‚Äôs important to note that
    temporary registers, denoted by `{{p-}}`, are exempt from this process and
    their content is not saved to disk.
- Response display targets: This refers to the destination where the response
    from ChatGPT is displayed. The plugin offers flexibility in choosing the
    target, allowing for a more tailored user experience.


REGISTERS                                       *simplegpt-features-registers*


AN EXAMPLE OF TEMPLATE RENDERING ~

To illustrate the core template rendering mechanism of SimpleGPT, consider the
following example. We have a template in the 't' register:

"I am currently working on a {{filetype}} file. The content of the file is:
{{content}}. I have selected the following lines: {{visual}}. My question is:
{{q}}."

The register values are:

- `{{filetype}}` is 'markdown'
- `{{content}}` is 'This is a sample markdown file.'
- `{{visual}}` is 'This is a selected.'
- `{{q}}` is 'How can I improve this line?'

The constructed question becomes:

"I am currently working on a markdown file. The content of the file is: This is
a sample markdown file. I have selected the following lines: This is a selected
line. My question is: How can I improve this line?"

Registers are of two types:

- Native vim registers: Standard Vim registers like 't', 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. used for storing and retrieving text.
- Special registers: Specific to SimpleGPT, including `{{content}}`, `{{filetype}}`, `{{visual}}`, and `{{q}}`. They store special values used in the template process. The `{{q}}` register allows for an editable question when rendering the whole content.

==============================================================================
7. Limitations                                         *simplegpt-limitations*

- It only leverage the `ChatCompletion` API (which is the most powerful and frequently used in the future trend).
- It is based on Vim registers, which may conflict with users‚Äô usage of them.
